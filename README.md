# LeetCode Problems: 
<!--- Screenshot Here --->
A repository containing all of the LeetCode problems I do to practice data structures and algorithms.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Every few days I solve a LeetCode problem to continue learning and growing as a developer.

## Optimizations

Often my initial attempt at a problem is a naive solution but after solving it I learn how to solve the problem using an appropriate algorithm for a more optimal solution.

## Lessons Learned:

What I learned from solving these problems is how to effectively utilize algorithms to solve problems thus making me a better developer.
